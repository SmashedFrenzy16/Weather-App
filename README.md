# Weather App

## About

These are some weather app scripts (CLI and GUI) that I made in Python.

## Prerequisites:

- `suntime` module - `pip install suntime`

## Run

CLI:

  - Run `python3 weather_app_cli.py` in a terminal if you have Mac/Linux
  - Run `python weather_app_cli.py` in a terminal if you have Windows.
